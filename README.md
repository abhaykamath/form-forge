# Form Forge

**Form Forge** is a dynamic form builder that lets developers visually configure form fields and auto-generates clean JSX code powered by React Hook Form.  
Built with performance, developer experience, and real-world form logic in mind.

## ✨ Features

- 🔧 Add and configure input types: text, number, email, password, select, radio, checkbox
- 🎛️ Config panel with live editing of label, name, placeholder, and options
- ✅ Live preview of the generated form with full interactivity
- 🧠 Built-in validation support (required, min/max length, etc.)
- ⚡ Auto-generated JSX with React Hook Form integration
- 🌗 Dark mode / light mode support via Shadcn UI
- 🔄 Drag-and-drop reordering of form fields
- 📤 Submit the form and see real-time output
- 📋 Copy or export generated code/config (coming soon)

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **React** + **TypeScript**
- **React Hook Form** for form state and validation
- **React DnD Kit** for drag-and-drop
- **Tailwind CSS** + **Shadcn UI** for consistent styling
- **React Syntax Highlighter** for JSX code output

## 🛠️ Why I Built This

After years of building forms manually across products, I created **Form Forge** to streamline the developer workflow — from field configuration to validation to integration-ready JSX.

This is a solo project I’ve architected from scratch, and I’m excited to open it up for improvements, ideas, and real-world use cases.
