# Contributing to Form Forge

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹  
Thanks for checking out Form Forge â€” a dynamic, UI-based form builder that generates React Hook Form code.

This project started as a personal devtool idea, and Iâ€™m excited to open it up for contributions. Whether you're fixing bugs, improving the UI, or adding new field types â€” you're welcome!

## ðŸ“Œ Contribution Guidelines
- Use TypeScript and follow the project's existing code style.
- Use Shadcn UI + Tailwind components wherever possible.
- Keep components modular and reusable.
- Write clear commit messages.
- Keep PRs focused â€” 1 feature or fix per PR is ideal.

## âœ… Good First Issues
- Add validation UI for number input (min, max)
- Add a new input type: Date Picker
- Add "Copy JSX to Clipboard" button
- Improve drag-and-drop animations on reorder
- Make preview form mobile responsive
- Add import/export of form config as JSON

You can also suggest your own feature or improvement by opening an issue first!

## ðŸ§  Codebase Highlights
`/components` â€“ modular UI components (builder, preview, config panels).

`/utils` â€“ utility functions (form config, JSX generation).

`/types` â€“ shared TypeScript interfaces for field configs, validation schema, etc.

## ðŸ“¬ Questions?
